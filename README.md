This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, bug in JavaScript related to type coercion in arithmetic operations. The `bug.js` file shows the buggy code where the + operator concatenates strings instead of adding numbers.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to avoid this problem using explicit type checking or using the correct mathematical operator for numbers. This example highlights the importance of strict type checking in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure correct program execution.
